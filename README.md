## Overview

_Battleship_ is a multiplayer forum game based on the board game by the same name. The original game is built for two opponents, and each player hides their battleships and attempts to sink their opponent’s. This forum game expands the formula for any number of players:



1. One grid exists for everyone to place their battleships on
2. The grid is updated every round to reflect where battleships have been hit
    1. The battleship type and its owner are announced when it is sunk
3. The last player with battleships remaining wins


## Details

The game is traditionally played on four grids, two for each player. In this game, one public grid is used for all players. The grids are typically square, and the individual squares in the grid are identified by letter and number (e.g. A1, C3). The grid’s size is determined by the number of participants, which isn’t fixed.

Before play begins, each player arranges their ships on the grid in private. Each ship occupies a number of consecutive squares on the grid, arranged either horizontally or vertically. The number of squares for each ship is determined by the type of the ship (more details in “Types of Ships”). The player’s own ships cannot overlap (i.e., only one ship can occupy any given square in the grid), but may overlap with someone else’s ship. Each player has the same amount of ships of each type.

After the ships have been positioned, the game proceeds in a series of rounds. In each round, each player chooses a target square in the grid to shoot. At the end of the round, if it is a "hit", the host announces that the square is occupied by a ship, without specifying the ship’s owner, and marks the square with a red peg. In the original game, the attacking player would note the hit or miss on their own "tracking" grid with the appropriate color peg (red for "hit", white for "miss"), in order to build up a picture of the opponent's fleet. In this game, players do not know which squares have been targeted previously by other players.

When all of the squares of a ship have been hit, the ship is sunk, and the ship's owner is announced. If all of a player's ships have been sunk, they lose and leave the game. When only one player has battleships remaining on the grid, they win and the game is over. In case the final players lose at the same time, the winner is decided with a coin flip.


### Types of Ships

The 1990 Milton Bradley version of _Battleship_ specifies the following ships for each player:
